### Monday  
* We have talked about what Big Data is, but now we need to take a look at the data itself and figure out how to work with it. Read the [Analyzing Data Notes](/ap/curriculum/data_science/analyzing_data/notes/) online to learn about getting data ready and gathering information from said data.
* Work on the Exploring Trends assignment in Teams (remember to use your APA email to log in if you have gotten logged out)
* After you have completed the assignment, go to [Unit 4, Lesson 2 in Code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2019/stage/2/puzzle/1?section_id=2525239) and answer the **4** questions in Check Your Understanding if you didn't do them by accident last week

### Tuesday  
* Read *Connecting the Dots* section of the book [Blown to Bits (linked here)](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf), starting on page 32 through page 35
* Then head over to Teams and complete the assignment to go along with the reading (will be posted up first thing Tues morning); this will be due Friday
* There will also be a discussion in the [Q4 channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a73fa7b85ae134551873abf47c88be3a4%40thread.skype/Q4%2520-%2520Data%2520Science%2520and%2520Impact%2520of%2520Computing?groupId=d53e228c-3a1a-4789-b122-bf4cbeee01f5&tenantId=bb0d39a7-51ab-4b2a-b2a5-2892b0361a99) that you will need to post at least one response to by **Tuesday night at midnight**; again, this will be up first thing Tues morning.

### Wednesday  
* Start on Lesson 3 in [Unit 4 on Code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2019?section_id=2525239)
* Make sure that you are going through the Resources on the first page of the lesson. There is an activity guide that you will do along with reading documents and viewing a video. with those resources you will answer the questions in the activity guide. 
* I will create an assignment in Teams so you can upload your finished activity guide
* **This is to be done independently and should be turned in by tomorrow morning at 10 so we can discuss and go over answers**
